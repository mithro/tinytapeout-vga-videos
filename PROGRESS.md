# Progress log

Newest entry first. One entry per working session, plus mid-session notes
whenever something non-obvious is learned. This file is the resume point
if work stops for lack of credits or tokens: read it, then `docs/status.md`,
then the newest `data/results/` entries.

## 2026-09-15: research and design

Done:
- Researched the Tiny Tapeout "simulator": it is the VGA Playground
  (Verilator in WASM, browser only). Copied its conventions into the design
  (bit layout, reset sequence, polarity detection, source discovery).
- Counted targets from tinytapeout-project-search: 440 Tiny VGA matches on
  24 shuttles; 312 at ~25 MHz, 49 with no clock given, 79 at other rates;
  420 Verilog/SystemVerilog; 64 also match the Gamepad Pmod; 87 known
  working on silicon.
- Probed hosts. Only one host gives the orchestrator passwordless sudo, so
  only there can the dedicated user be created without help. One host has a
  changed SSH host key. Details deliberately not recorded here.
- Wrote the design spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-vga-videos-design.md`)
  and host setup notes (`docs/host-setup.md`).

Decisions from the owner:
- Keep this log, commit often; work may stop at any time.
- Phase 1 is RTL simulation with Verilator; gate-level is phase 2.
- Videos stay on the big simulation host for now; later data.wafer.space,
  possibly YouTube with title card and outro (not now).
- Run only under a dedicated unprivileged user on the hosts.
- MJPEG, native resolution; storage is not a concern.
- At most two sub-agents at once.

Open questions: see "Questions" in the README until answered.

Next:
- Get answers to the open questions.
- Scaffold the package: `targets`, `harness/tb.cpp`, `decode`, `encode`,
  `remote`, `queue`, tests.
- Pilot on 5 projects on one host, measure cycles/s, tune the decoder.
